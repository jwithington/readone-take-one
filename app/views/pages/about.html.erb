<h3>About: ReadOne</h3>
<p>
	This web application was initially created with
	<%= link_to('Rails Composer', 'http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer/') %>
	from the <%= link_to('RailsApps project', 'http://railsapps.github.io/') %>. 
</p>
<p>
	Much of the code was generated using the amazing <%= link_to('Hartl Tutorial', 
	'https://www.railstutorial.org/book') %> as a guide.
